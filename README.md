# Neovim Configuration

## Introduction

This is a personal Neovim configuration. The goal is to have a setup that is tailored to my workflow, while being easy to maintain and extend.

This configuration was originally based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). While it has been significantly modified to suit my needs, credit goes to the original authors for providing an excellent starting point.
